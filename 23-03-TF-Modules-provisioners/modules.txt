Module is helping you to structure your terraform project.

Its a container which is adding multiple resources together.
In a project we should have atleast 1 module.

We can create reusable modules for organizing and reusing of
code.

make project structure like

    main-folder
        modules
            mod-1
                main.tf 
                outputs.tf
                variables.tf
            mod-2
                main.tf 
                outputs.tf
                variables.tf
        main.tf
        outputs.tf 
        variables.tf
        terraform.tf

Here also implemented Remote Backend so using that we can maintain the state 
now using s3 bucket..

storing terraform.tfstate file isside s3 bucket
