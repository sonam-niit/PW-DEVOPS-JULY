TF Workspace?

It a feature of TF which is allowing us to manage multiple environments
like (dev, prod, staging) by using common configuration.

When we are working with tf it provides default Workspace
later on we can create Workspace as per our requirement

        isolate state: manage state specific for diffrent environments
        simplily configuration: common
