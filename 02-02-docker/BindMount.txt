BindMount:
    Maps a directory or some file on the host to the container
    you can give the absoulte path and you can use shared resources.

To work with this Bind Mount

Create one directory in your C: drive
name it website
create one index.html file in that and add some sample code
We want to share this directory between host and container
    docker run -d --name my_container -v C:/website:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx
    Check localhost:8080

if you are seeing your html code rather the default nginx page you can confirm 
the bind Mount done successfully.
========================================================================================
Let's assume you are are some palce in your directory linux
> mkdir website
> cd website
> echo 'Sample Hello From HTML' > index.html
> cd ..

docker run -d --name my_container -v "$(pwd)"/website:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx
